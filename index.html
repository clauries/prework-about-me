      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a mom of a toddler and wife of a Magic the Gathering player. Our last name is pronounced "Shray-der."</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Milwaukie, OR</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to learn which often takes form in reading, listening to podcasts, and following internet rabbit holes.</p>
      <p>Cooking is a favorite past time - although baking can be a bit finicky for me.</p>
      <p>Board games are big in our household. Our current favorites are Eldritch Horror and Gloomhaven.</p>
      <p>I like video games but don't have much time for them. My current game of choice is Stardew Valley.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Developing content for an organization like Gallup where I can combine coding with my training in personal and team development. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Milwaukie, OR</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm excited to use technology to help people develop themselves and their team.</p>
      <p>I have long been frustrated with knowing there are programs or websites doing things similar to what I want to do, but not knowing how to make it happen. I'm excited to start learning how to get the computer & web to work for me. </p>
      <p>Coding is an ever-evolving craft. I'm looking forward to honing this skill for many years to come.</p>
      <p>Also, as we're looking to grow our family, I've been looking for skills that offer flexibility depending on our family needs. Web Developers can be full time or part time, work from an office or home, work during any hour of the day, etc.</p>
